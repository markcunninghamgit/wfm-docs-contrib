# Introduction

Welcome to the Warframe.market developer documentation.

These docs describe the public contracts for Warframe.market HTTP APIs, realtime WebSocket messages, shared data models, OAuth plans, and public API-client rules.

## Current State

The current API and WebSocket contracts are still below `1.0`. Expect changes, including breaking changes, while the new public API is being rolled out.

New API endpoints are added gradually. Some areas are already documented, while others may still be missing or incomplete.

The v1 reference covers account authentication, HTTP contracts, and statistics during the transition to v2. A v1-issued bearer token has been verified with the authenticated v2 `GET /v2/me` endpoint. See the [v1 documentation](/docs/v1/intro).

## OAuth 2.0 Status

OAuth 2.0 is still in development and is not available to public integrations yet.

It is not currently possible to register your own OAuth client. For now, integrations that require user authorization still need to rely on the existing v1 authorization flow.

We know this is not ideal, and we are sorry for the messy transition period.
